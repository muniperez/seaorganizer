					<p>Seafarers have a lot of certificates and most of them have expiration dates. Keeping track of them is a hassle and that's why we created SeaOrganizer.</p>

					<p>Made by seafarers to seafarers, this app keeps track of your certificates and send you alerts whenever you have to worry about them.</p>

					<p>It is really simple and easy to use. You only need to insert your information once and we will do the rest for you.</p>

					<p>It gets even better! When a number of people in the same region have their certificates about to expire, we will offer discounted prices on training courses so they can renew their trainings paying less!</p>

					<p>Join us today and invite your friends!</p>
